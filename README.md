# ReMovies🍿

Removies is a project in which the TMDB API was used to bring information from movies. In this project I used nextjs, css for the layouts and I also tested my learning in redux toolkit to handle the movie information.

## Getting Started 🚀

First we install the necessary libraries:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
